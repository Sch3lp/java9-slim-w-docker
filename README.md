# Purpose
Because BitBucket pipelines doesn't support docker-compose as a service...[yet](https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/14568/support-reading-docker-compose-file-for)

## Now also includes AWSCLI
So you can push built docker images to AWS ECR.

Based on [mesosphere/awscli](https://hub.docker.com/r/mesosphere/aws-cli/~/dockerfile/).
